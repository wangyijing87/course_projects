The following analytical approaches are taken in our analysis:
● Data Preparation: Prepare raw data for analysis
● Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Perform dimension reduction techniques to identify a new set of orthogonal variables
● Cluster Analysis: Classification of wines based on physicochemical properties
● Regression Analysis: Prediction of quality ranking from the chemical properties of the wines using Ordinal Multinomial Logistic Regression
